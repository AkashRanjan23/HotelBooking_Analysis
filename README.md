Overview
Welcome to the Hotel Booking Analysis Capstone Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to extract insights and patterns that can be valuable for the hospitality industry. The dataset used in this project contains information about hotel bookings, including customer details, booking dates, and various other relevant factors.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:

1- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and gain insights into customer behavior.

2- Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict booking cancellations or other relevant outcomes. Evaluate the models' performance and provide recommendations for improving booking management.

3- Visualization: Create informative visualizations to effectively communicate key findings and insights. This includes interactive charts and graphs to enhance the understanding of the data.

4- Documentation: Maintain clear and concise documentation of the entire analysis process, including data preprocessing, model development, and visualization. This will enable others to replicate and build upon the analysis.
